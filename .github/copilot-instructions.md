# Coding Guidelines

* Always use function based views in django
* Always add docstring at the beginning of every function
* Always use pytest for unit tests generation
* Always use alpinejs and htmx
* Always check for adding imports at the beginning of the files if you add things not already imported
* Always use:
  * kebab case for naming template files
  * snake case for naming functions
  * pascal case for naming models
