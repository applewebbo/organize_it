Add the ability to add a transfer from the last event or last stay of the last day to the main transfer departure location.

## Context
Before departing via main transfer (e.g., flight), users need to get from their last destination to the departure point. This feature adds a quick way to create that connecting transfer.

## Checklist
- [ ] Identify where main transfer departure info is stored
- [ ] Add UI button/option to create transfer from last event/stay to departure
- [ ] Implement view logic to create the transfer with pre-filled locations
- [ ] Add/update tests
